# Automation Notes
This repo is automatically updated by [zxaos/patchup](https://github.com/zxaos/patchup).

While it shouldn't be necessary, you can also manually check for upstream changes by sending the repository dispatch API event with the `on-demand-check` event type:
```
curl -u username:oauth_token
     -X "POST" "https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/trafficserver/dispatches" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{ "event_type": "on-demand-check" }'
```

## Branches
Some branches directly track upstream. **if you commit to these branches, your changes will be lost**:
* master
* 7.1.x
* 8.1.x
* 9.0.x

Instead, commits should be applied to the appropriate `-netlify` branches:
* master-netlify
* 7.1.x-netlify
* 8.1.x-netlify
* 9.0.x-netlify

Commits on these branches will attepmt to be merged with upstream when possible.
